JavaScript

This Project is done to enhance my learning in DOM in JavaScript. DOM which usually stands for "Document Object Model". The DOM is a JavaScript representation of a Webpage and it is a bunch of objects that you can interact with via JS. I have used "Bulma" to design the webpage. Bulma is a free, open source framework that provides ready-to-use frontend components that you can easily combine to build responsive web interfaces
